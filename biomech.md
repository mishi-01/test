      Collection of Data: Force Required to Pierce through Porcine Skin Samples 
      Development of a Testing Protocol and Associated Apparatus
      
      The various instrons used throughout a year of trial-and-error mechanical testing
      
      In an effort to collect data most representative of incising human tissue, porcine skin samples were used to mimic the human's epigastric region. However, simplying laying a slab of greasy pig skin on top of an instron is neither sanitary, nor effective due to it's, well, ridiculous amount of grease. Applying a downward force via the instron would simply cause the sample to jiggle across the stage, resulting in erroneous data. 
      
      I know this because ... well, we tried it with the BOSE system. You have to learn how to walk before you can fly, right? So our advisor at the time had us do this little exercise (which took about, oh, just an entire month) to teach us this lesson. 
       
       Of course, it wasn't all for-naught. Correlating our sample's initial dance moves with the resulting data-points revealed an interesting issue with our data: miniscule peaks and valleys across our graphs from other iterations of our mechanical test that we had actually thought held promise. 
       
       These "other iterations" were basically attempts at trying to model the human epigastric region as closely as possible. Take for example, the knowledge that our stomachs, in general (can't speak for everybody!!), are muscular, HOLLOW organs. (Special thanks to PubMed Health for this information !). So clearly, laying a slab of pork skin atop the instron was not mimicking the stomach's hollow nature. We were advised to design and construct a box that would allow for the skin to be afixed to it's ends, and 
       
       The resulting box was built from aluminum, with sandpaper epoxyed to it's sides. Steel plates were cut to the same dimension of the box's sides, and also had sandpaper epoxyed. The skin sample was meant to be sandiwched between the box's sides and the steel plates, with the sandpaper keeping grip on it's greasy surface. 
       
       However, with the box completely hollow, there was no resistance against the downward force from the BOSE and the sample was continuously pushed to the bottom of the box, yielding incredibly bizarre results. It doesn't seem realistic for 140N to be needed to incise a piece of pork skin right? 
       
       Turns out that the stomach is not completely hallow. We have muscular tissue and fluid and ======; all of which provides the stomach with much needed stability, which clearly our aluminum box was lacking. We were then advised to ditch the box and affix the samples directly to a sheet of neoprene rubber instead. 
       
       
       
       Throughout this journey of constructing an adequate testing environment, we were also confronted with the task of === scalpel blade. Simply tightening the instron's ---- hands? around the scalpel was not effective enough, as the hands could not properly grip the scalpel. And so every time the scalpel was lowered to apply downward force, it would shift and ====mess all that up. When in acutality the scalpel blade is held at a specific angle in a specifi way to ensure the safest and best cut.  
       
       So, a scalpel holder was modeled and 3D printed in such a fashion that it could snugly fit between the instron's clamps. The scalpel blades were removed from their handles, and epoxyed to these 3D printed holders. Epoxyed maaintained this special angle! Throughtout the many iterations of testing, the holder's design was also modified as we saw fit. Most notably was producing a more tapered bottom, since we found that the original design was impinging the tissue during compression testing, yielding ====== data.
