      Collection of Data: Force Required to Pierce through Porcine Skin Samples 
      Development of a Testing Protocol and Associated Apparatus
      
      In an effort to collect data most representative of incising human tissue, porcine skin samples were used to mimic the human's epigastric region. However, simplying laying a slab of greasy pig skin on top of an instron is neither sanitary, nor effective due to it's, well, ridiculous amount of grease. Applying a downward force via the instron would simply cause the sample to jiggle across the stage, resulting in erroneous data. 
      
      I know this because ... well, we tried it with the BOSE system. You have to learn how to walk before you can fly, right? So our advisor at the time had us do this little exercise (which took about, oh, just an entire month) to teach us this lesson. 
       
       Of course, it wasn't all for-naught. Correlating our sample's initial dance moves with the resulting data-points revealed an interesting issue with our data: miniscule peaks and valleys across our graphs from other iterations of our mechanical test that we had actually thought held promise. 
       
       These "other iterations" were basically attempts at trying to model the human epigastric region as closely as possible. Take for example, the knowledge that our stomachs, in general (can't speak for everybody, right?), are muscular, HOLLOW organs. (Special thanks to PubMed Health for this information !). So clearly, laying a slab of pork skin atop the instron was not mimicking the stomach's hollow nature. We were advised to design and construct a box
