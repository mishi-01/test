            <p>Simulation has been explored as a valuable tool for training and assessment in both medical and non-medical fields to provide additional, controlled, repeatable practice that may reduce human-factor errors during the real situation. Throughout the field of surgery, various high fidelity virtual reality simulators exist, but as of this moment none address basic surgery skills through an immersive virtual environment. This proposed work suggests a dynamic simulator design that primarily focuses on the basics of scalpel, cautery and suture use, while enhancing the user’s quality of training by immersing them in a virtual environment with appropriate assistive visual guides. To illustrate how vital this sort of development is to surgical training, please note that during a study conducted in 2015 by Drexel University’s College of Medicine: Department of Surgery (see: references), it was found that only three of 15 PGY2 surgical residents knew how to hold a scalpel correctly. 
            <p>Currently, the focus of this work centers on A) integration and manipulation of key elements in the VR environment, B) guiding the user’s hand to match to the correct scalpel-holding pose, and C) assisting the user in applying the adequate amount of force needed, to make the first surgical incision. The design is meant to be constructed with some of the appropriate medical/engineering standards in mind, with the hope that it can eventually be used by medical trainees, surgical instructors, and even the layman to provide a comprehensive training paradigm of the basic surgical skills needed for open surgery.</p>
